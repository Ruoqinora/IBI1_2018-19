# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:


- [ ] On https://ruoqinora.github.io/ most of the text (except in the banner) is unchanged from the template text. Modify it to make it more specific.












 




### Feedback Week 4:




- [ ] In file variables.py, you should define variables Z and W as specified in the practical instructions. 



- [ ] The code computing the Collatz sequence works, but you should use pseudocode to plan and document your work.


- [ ] The file mystery_code.py should contain an answer that explains what the code does.



- [ ] The maths in your "powers of 2" exercise seems correct. But as a user, if I input a number (e.g. 1750), I never see any result printed on the screen. How can this be fixed?




### Feedback Week 5:


- [ ] In the nucleotide counting script: When asking the user for input, include a prompt, such as "Please enter a DNA sequence", so that the user knows what they are supposed to do 
- [ ] The code to compute and display nucleotide numbers only works if the sequence is given with spaces between the letters (e.g. "G A T T A C A", not "GATTACA"). This is counter-intuitive. You have two options: Either amend the code so that it works without spaces, or explicitly tell the user that they are required to input the sequence with spaces.



- [ ] In the script that reverses and orders a string, the input function should include a prompt, so the user knows what to do.






This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored 80 out of 100
